# Crowd Movement

A notebook for fitting and evaluating models for daily counts of pedestrians. Generalization is tested through fitting on data collected from Stockholm and testing on data from Gothenburg.

The models are used in the Crowd Movement project that aims to support decision making in urban planning through analyzing pedestrian movement flows in public space by linking macroscale and microscale simulations.

Data is not yet publicly available.
